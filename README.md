# Toasted-Marshmellows

A tower defence game with inspiration from plants vs zombies.
The goal is to stop the enemies (marshmellows) from reaching the Turret.

The marshmellows spawn from the right hand side of the screen in 5 different rows and walk towards the Turret on the left.

The Turret shoots different projectiles with different characteristics and damage dealing mechanics down the row the Turret is in.
Each projectiles shoots at regular intervals (shown on the left) and the player moves the Turret up and down the different rows.
